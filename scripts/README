This directory contains some scripts for working with a VMware Fusion dev vm.

Requirements: plumbum (directly from the git repo at
https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum until a version > 0.9 is in Pypi), and
vmrunwrapper (http://github.com/racker/vmrunwrapper)

The setup_vm.py script downloads a VM image, copies it to the default VMware
VM location, and bootstraps the VM.

The setup_vm.py script should be called from the chef repo root:

    cd <root of this chef repo>; python scripts/setup_vm.py


In order for vmrunwrapper to know which VM you want to manipulate, please set the environment variable VMRUNWRAPPER_CONF to point to
scripts/vmrunwrapper.conf once it has been generated (by the setup_vm.py
script).  Then, add vmwrap-up to somewhere on your path (not an alias).  This
way, `vmwrap up` (run from anywhere) should do approximately the same thing
`vagrant up` would do for a VirtualBox VM.

TL;DR version:
 1. export VMRUNWRAPPER_CONF=<chef repo>/scripts/vmrunwrapper.conf
 2. export PATH=<chef repo>/scripts:$PATH
